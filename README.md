# Trumpinator

Trumpinator is a tool for editing videos of US Presidential speeches. It uses IBM's Watson to generate exact timestamps for each word from various sources and FFmpeg to reorder them to create new sentences (like [cassetteboy](https://www.youtube.com/user/cassetteboy/videos?flow=grid&view=0&sort=p)).

It was built in a weekend for [Hack the Burgh 2017](http://2017.hacktheburgh.com/) and it won the Bloomberg prize for "Hacking with a Manifesto"
